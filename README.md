ECMP hashed forwarding


Data center networks every so often use compactly interconnected topologies to deliver high bandwidth for internal data exchange. 
In such network, it is precarious to employ effective load balancing schemes so that all the available bandwidth resources can be utilized.
To make proficient use of network resources, satisfy user demands, and in order to adapt to network conditions, network operators do 
traffic engineering (TE), i.e., managing traffic how it is getting routed across the network. Traffic engineering tries to optimize both 
network efficiency and the performance to the current network conditions. Equal Cost Multipath (ECMP) is one of the traffic engineering 
methods that enable the usage of multiple equal cost paths from the source node to the destination node in the network. The advantage is 
that the traffic can be split more uniformly to the whole network avoiding congestion and increasing bandwidth consumption.

Here we are trying to implement and validate ECMP load balancing algorithm in SDN enabled environment
